  * This app get information of Api PokeApi and show the pokemon that user want, for this, the user might write the name or id of pokemon and then get click of button search


# `Development process`

* Read and analyze documentation (challenge)
* Creating components, and home pages to structure the application with semantic HTML, all taking into account the Atomic Design methodology.
* Create of services for get information of api PokeApi for Id or Name.
* Create Products context for get a state global in the app
* Create useProducts for separate the logic of UI and there can use it in anywhere of app. This in order that if you change the technology or framework can easily reuse this logic or is required to migrate to mobile for example with react native.
* The styles were used module css, this to make it more friendly to declare the className, all the design was made responsive design.
* Necessary tags were added to have a good SEO performance.
* I missed to make a test, because the time given was not possible, if I could have done one, I would have done an end2end test to validate the rendering of the app.
